Hi dear devs, I've tried to finish the whole application, but I did not have enough time for it, if you would like, I can finish it later. 

### How to start ###

```javascript
npm install
npm start
```

### Basic source guideline ###

* **src/app/** - Front end.
* **src/server/** - Back end.

### What was done ###

#### Manager

* **[B][F]** Create waiter.
* **[B][F]** Create table.
* **[B][F]** Create product.
* **[B]** Assign tables to waiter.

#### Waiter

* **[B]** See tables assigned to him.
* **[B]** Create order for table.
* **[B]** Create ProductInOrder for Order.
* **[B]** Edit ProductInOrder fields.
* **[B]** Edit order fields.

\***[B]** is Backend.  
\***[F]** is Frontend.

### P.S. ###
I've seen that this task was the modified version of [this project](https://github.com/alahijani/zprojects). I think that's enough to have simple task, when projects becomes little bit complex, there was need to close all possible cases, which requires more time.
